# Pentester copilot

Pentester Copilot is a versatile tool designed to assist penetration testers in their work. It leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide intelligent suggestions and support during various stages of a penetration test. Pentester Copilot aims to make the pentesting process more efficient by offering a wide range of functionalities, such as strategy suggestion, payload generation, note-taking, and phishing email creation.

Please note that while Pentester Copilot strives to offer helpful and accurate information, the tool is still in development and its features may not be perfect. There is room for improvement, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions from the community.

# How Pentester Copilot Works

Pentester Copilot uses the GPT-4 AI model to generate responses based on the user's input. The tool requires an API key to access the GPT-4 engine, which can be obtained from OpenAI's website. Once you have the API key, you need to place it in the config.ini file as follows:

```
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

Replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key.

To start using Pentester Copilot, simply run the ***main.py*** file. The tool will present a menu with several options, such as strategy suggestion, payload generation, note-taking, and phishing email creation. You can choose the desired functionality by entering the corresponding number in the menu. Based on your input, the tool will ask for additional information and generate a response using the GPT-4 engine.

# What you can do

## Strategy Suggestion
The Strategy Suggestion feature helps you generate a penetration testing strategy based on the target environment, known vulnerabilities, network topology, and available tools. By answering a few questions, the AI will provide you with a recommended approach to conducting your penetration test. Here's an example screenshot of how the feature works:

## Payload Generation
The Payload Generation feature streamlines the process of creating custom payloads for specific targets. You can choose from a list of available payloads and provide details such as target software, payload format, LHOST, LPORT, and file name. The AI will then generate a payload for you. Here's an example screenshot of the Payload Generation feature in action:

## Take Notes
The Take Notes feature assists you in organizing your notes during the penetration testing process. It allows you to input notes about different machines, web apps, domains, and more. These notes are then formatted into a Markdown file for easy reference and sharing. Here's an example screenshot of the Take Notes feature:

## Write Phishing Email
The Write Phishing Email feature helps you generate realistic and effective phishing emails. By providing a brief description of the phishing scenario, the AI will create a phishing email tailored to your specifications. This feature can be valuable in social engineering assessments and testing the security awareness of your target audience. Here's an example screenshot of the Write Phishing Email feature:
